# odin-recipes

I'm Jeff and this is my first project. By the end of this project, I expect to have a relative level of comfort in the following things:

    - Terminal and Command Line
    - HTML
    - Working with Git
    - Writing good commit messages
    - ETC

I look forward to looking back at this at the end of my journey.
